* B BETA III IV I AXLE (HQ) (EX) (IP) (TR) (BY)
FROM his     shoulder      Hiawatha
Took      the camera of    rosewood
    Made of   sliding folding rosewood
Neatly  put           it all together
In its case it lay compactly
Folded into nearly nothing
But he opened out the hinges
Pushed and pulled the joints
   and hinges
Till it looked all squares
   and oblongs
Like a complicated figure
in the Second Book of Euclid
